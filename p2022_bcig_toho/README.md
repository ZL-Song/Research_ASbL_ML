### Explaining Toho/AMP and Toho/CEX acylation pathways (Glu166 sole base and Lys73/Glu166 concerted base mechanisms) using BCIG method for contribution attribution on deep-and-wide NN models, which are trained on 800 QM/MM MEPs. 
- Preprocessed data after the feature selection is stored at: 2.datasets/3.feature_sel/conf_ds/\*.npy. Other directories hold no data due to size limitations.
